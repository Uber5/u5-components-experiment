# u5-components-experiment

Experimental, (hopefully) reusable React Components

# Run Tests (etc) in Development

In general: Use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), not `npm`.

    yarn dev:watch

This will run
[jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/),
[Flow type checking](https://flow.org/) and
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/),
while you focus on implementing great functionality.

# Run Storybook in Development

    yarn run storybook

## How to Publish

Seems like `npm publish` works, even though I got errors ("cafile not found"?)
along the way. `yarn publish` seems to have issues with scoped
packages / private registries, see <https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/606>
(also check <https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2541>)
